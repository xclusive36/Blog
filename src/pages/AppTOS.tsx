              <strong>About these Terms</strong>
              <br />
              We may modify these terms or Services at any time. We’ll post
              notice of modifications to these Terms and Services on this page.
              We’ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable
              Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become
              effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted.
              However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes
              made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do
              not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should
              discontinue your use of that Service.
            </p>

            <p className="ion-padding">
              If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional
              terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.
            </p>

            <p className="ion-padding">
              These terms control the relationship between LiteStep and you.
              They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.

            <p className="ion-padding">
              If you do not comply with these terms, and we don’t take action
              right away, this doesn’t mean that we are giving up any rights
              that we may have (such as taking action in the future).

            <p className="ion-padding">
              If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this
              will not affect any other terms.
